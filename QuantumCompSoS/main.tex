\section{Introduction}
Through this Summer of Science report, I attempt to summarise everything I covered related to Quantum Computing and Quantum Information Theory. We will mainly follow the book \textbf{Quantum Computation and Quantum Information} by \textbf{Nielsen and Chuang}. We will begin by going through the mathematical preliminaries, including an introduction to the linear algebraic treatment of Quantum Mechanics through which we will explore Quantum Computation. Then we will move onto qubits, their representation and on the way we will study and go through various fascinating Quantum algorithms and their uses. Hopefully through this report one will be able to gain a decent understanding of Quantum Computation.
